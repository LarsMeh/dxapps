# DXApp hello world example and template
This repository provides a minimal hello world example to serve as a template for developing applications (dxapps) for
[DXRAM](https://github.com/hhu-bsinfo/dxram/). Further documentation on how to develop applications for DXRAM can be
found in the docs of the [DXRAM repository](https://github.com/hhu-bsinfo/dxram/).

# Build instructions and deployment
Simply run the *build.sh* script. The output jar is located under *build/libs*. Copy the file to the *dxapp* folder of
your DXRAM deployment. By default, the application is launched on every Peer automatically after DXRAM finished
booting.
